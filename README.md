<h1 id="about-the-project"> 📓 About The Project </h1>
In this project given dataset is analyzed and the table with the highest correlation with price table is picked as the feature of the linear regression model. Then, the dataset is divided into two sets: training and test datasets. Afterwards, the model is built and trained on training dataset. In the model Root Mean Squared Error is used as a loss function. At the end trained model is used to predict the prices in the test dataset and the accuracy of predictions is determined by the coefficient of determination called R squared.

The project was built to learn the basics of linear regression and expand my knowledge of machine learning.
